AAD Pod Identity enables Kubernetes applications to access cloud resources securely with [Azure Active Directory] (AAD).

Using Kubernetes primitives, administrators configure identities and bindings to match pods. Then without any code modifications, your containerized applications can leverage any resource in the cloud that depends on AAD as an identity provider.

## v1.6.0 Breaking Change

With https://github.com/Azure/aad-pod-identity/pull/398, the [client-go](https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go) library is upgraded to v0.17.2, where CRD [fields are now case sensitive](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/64612). If you are upgrading MIC and NMI from v1.x.x to v1.6.0, MIC v1.6.0+ will upgrade the fields of existing `AzureIdentity` and `AzureIdentityBinding` on startup to the new format to ensure backward compatibility. A configmap called `aad-pod-identity-config` is created to record and confirm the successful type upgrade.

However, for future `AzureIdentity` and `AzureIdentityBinding` created using v1.6.0+, the following fields need to be changed:

### `AzureIdentity`

| < 1.6.0          | >= 1.6.0         |
| ---------------- | ---------------- |
| `ClientID`       | `clientID`       |
| `ClientPassword` | `clientPassword` |
| `ResourceID`     | `resourceID`     |
| `TenantID`       | `tenantID`       |

### `AzureIdentityBinding`

| < 1.6.0         | >= 1.6.0        |
| --------------- | --------------- |
| `AzureIdentity` | `azureIdentity` |
| `Selector`      | `selector`      |

### `AzurePodIdentityException`

| < 1.6.0     | >= 1.6.0    |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `PodLabels` | `podLabels` |
