## Introduction

AAD Pod Identity is disabled by default on clusters with Kubenet network plugin. The NMI pods will fail to run with error `AAD Pod Identity is not supported for Kubenet`.

## Why this change?

Kubenet network plugin is susceptible to ARP spoofing. This makes it possible for pods to impersonate as a pod with access to an identity. Using `CAP_NET_RAW` capability the attacker pod could then request token as a pod it's impersonating.

Network plugins like Azure CNI, Calico, Cilium prevents ARP Spoofing.

## Mitigation steps to take before running clusters with Kubenet

The recommended steps to take before configuring AAD Pod Identity to run on clusters with Kubenet network plugin

- Add a [`securityContext`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/) that drops the `NET_RAW` capability by default in your applications.
    ```yaml
    securityContext:
      capabilities:
        drop:
        - NET_RAW
    ```
  
  This shouldnâ€™t affect most applications, since it's only needed for applications that do deep networking inspection/manipulation. Dropping this capability will make sure even if your application code got compromised, the attacker could not perform such network-based attacks on your cluster.
 
## How to run AAD Pod Identity on clusters with Kubenet

Set the `--allow-network-plugin-kubenet=true` arg in the NMI container to continue running on clusters with Kubenet.
