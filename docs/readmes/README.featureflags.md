## Feature flags

## Enable Scale Features flag
> Available from 1.5.3 release

Aad-pod-identity adds labels to AzureAssignedIdentities which denote the nodename, podname and podnamespace.
When the optional parameter `enabledScaleFeatures` is set to 'true', the NMI watches for AzureAssignedIdentities will do a label based filtering on
the nodename label. This approach is taken because currently K8s does not support field selectors in CRD watches. This reduces the load which
NMIs add on API server. When this flag is enabled, NMI will no longer work for AzureAssignedIdentities which were created before 1.5.3-rc5, since
they don't have the labels. Hence please note that this flag renders your setup incompatible with releases before 1.5.3-rc5.

## Batch Create Delete flag
> Available from 1.5.3 release

MIC groups operations based on nodes/VMSS during the given cycle. With `createDeleteBatch` parameter we can
tune the number of operations (CREATE/DELETE/UPDATE) to the API server which are performed in parallel in the context of a
node/VMSS.

## Client QPS flag
> Available from 1.5.3 release

Aad-pod-identity has a new flag clientQps which can be used to control the total number of client operations performed per second
to the API server by MIC.

## Block Instance Metadata flag

The Azure Metadata API includes endpoints under `/instance/metadata` which
provide information about the virtual machine. You can see examples of this
endpoint in [the Azure documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/instance-metadata-service#retrieving-all-metadata-for-an-instance).

Some of the information returned by this endpoint may be considered sensitive
or secret. The response includes information on the operating system and image,
tags, resource IDs, network, and VM custom data.

This information is legitimately useful for many use cases, but also presents a
risk. If an attacker can exploit a vulnerability that allows them to read from
this endpoint, they may be able to access sensitive information even if the
vulnerable Pod does not use Managed Identity.

The `blockInstanceMetadata` flag for NMI will intercept any  requests to this
endpoint from Pods which are not using host networking and return an HTTP 403
Forbidden response. This flag is disabled by default to maximize compatibility.
Users are encouraged to determine if this option is relevant and beneficial for
their use cases.

## ImmutableUserMSIs flag
> Available from 1.5.4 release

Aad-pod-identity has a new flag `immutable-user-msis` which can be used to prevent deletion of specified identities from VM/VMSS.
The list is comma separated. Example: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000,11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111
