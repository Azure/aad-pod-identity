# AAD Pod Identity Tutorial

This tutorial is based on [this repository](https://github.com/xtellurian/aad-pods).

## Prerequisites

- [Azure Account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/)

In this tutorial we are going to be using the Azure CLI, bash scripts, and kubectl. There are three sections, and each section contains several scripts to run. You'll find all the scripts in the `/scripts` directory.

Lines like `./scripts/path/to/script.sh` indicate you should execute that script.

To begin, clone this repository

```sh

git clone https://github.com/Azure/aad-pod-identity
cd aad-pod-identity/docs/tutorial

```

### Using Azure CLI, kubectl and bash

The following steps require the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest), make sure to download and [login](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest) before starting.

If you're on Windows, you should use [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) or another Bash terminal.

You can install kubectl via the Azure CLI, or by [another method](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)

`az aks install-cli`

## 1. Create a Kubernetes Cluster on Azure (AKS)

### 1.1. Register the required resource types

`./scripts/1-init-aks/1-azure-provider-registration.sh`

AKS requires the following resources: Microsoft.Network, Microsoft.Storage, Microsoft.Compute, Microsoft.ContainerService. Register them on your subscription with the above script.


### 1.2. Create a Resource Group

Set an environment variable in your shell, for the name of your resource group.

`export RG ="k8s-test"`

This resource group is for your AKS cluster. Create it with this command.

`./scripts/1-init-aks/2-create-rg.sh`

### 1.3. Create Azure Kubernetes Service

This will create an AKS instance in the resource group created above. It may take a couple of minutes to complete. Set the name of the this command in the shell.

```sh

K8S_NAME="Cluster-Name"
./scripts/1-init-aks/3-create-aks.sh

```


### 1.4. Configure the kubernetes CLI - `kubectl`

With `kubectl` installed, run the following script

`./scripts/1-init-aks/4-configure-sli.sh`

Now the `kubectl` command should control your AKS cluster. Try it out, it should look similar to below:

```sh

$ kubectl get nodes
NAME                       STATUS    ROLES     AGE       VERSION
aks-nodepool1-15831963-0   Ready     agent     01h       v1.9.6

```

## 2. Configure AKS

### 2.1. Install Custom Resource Definitions

The following script installs three [custom resource definitions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/) on our kubernetes cluster.

`./scripts/2-config-aks/1-install-crd.sh`

The three CRDs are:

- azureAssignedIdentity: Do not create these objects, they will be auto-created by the azureIdentityController
- azureIdentityBinding: Binds pods to an Azure Id.  You will create these.
- azureIdentity: Provides the cluster with the ability to assign an identity to a pod. You will create these.

> Note: this step may be eliminated in the future.

### 2.2. Deploy the required infrastructure on the cluster

Pod Identities require two pods as pieces of infrastruture.

 1. Managed Identity Controller (MIC). A pod that binds Azure Ids to other pods - creates azureAssignedIdentity CRD. 
 2. Node Managed Identity (NMI). Identifies the pod based on the remote address of the incoming request, and then queries the k8s (through MIC) for a matching Azure Id. It then make a adal request to get the token for the client id and returns as a reponse to the request. Implemented as a [DaemonSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/).

Deploy the infrastructure with the following command

`./scripts/2-config-aks/2-deploy-infra.sh`

## 3. Deploy the demo

The demo is basic, but does prove the concept.

### 3.1. Create an Azure Id

We will be assigning the demo pod an [Azure Managed Service Identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-service-identity/overview). The Azure Id will need to be in the same Resource Group *as was created automatically by the provisioning of the AKS cluster* [see this issue for more information](https://github.com/Azure/aad-pod-identity/issues/38).

You might find the Resource Group name with

`az group list | grep $RG`

Then set the environment variable

`export MC_RG = "resource-group-name"`

Edit the script with the correct Resource Group name then run it as below

`./scripts/3-deploy-demo/1-create-azure-id.sh`

### 3.2. Deploy demo

The `/deploy/demo/deployment.yaml` describes the pod that will be deployed. You need to set the following args for the demo pod:

- subscriptionid: Id of your Azure Subscription
- clientid: From the Azure Id you created in the step above
- resourcegroup: From the Azure Id you created above

Now run the following to deploy the demo

`./scripts/3-deploy-demo/2-deploy-demo.sh`

### 3.3. Deploy Azure Id to Kubernetes

We need to tell the cluster about the Id we created, so it can bind it to the pod (the next step). To do that, we will deploy the spec found in `/deploy/demo/aadpodidentity.yaml`. You need to set the following values in that file:

- metadata->name: A unique name we will use in the next step to reference this Id.
- type: 0=Azure Identity; 1=Service Principal. You should set it to 0.
- ResourceID: subscriptionId, resource group, and id name. You can find this full string by running `az identity list` and looking at the `id` field.
- ClientID: Client Id of the Azure ID. You can find this full string by running `az identity list` and looking at the `clientId` field.

Once those values are set, you can deploy the identity with the following

`./scripts/3-deploy-demo/3-deploy-id-to-k8s.sh`

### 3.4. Bind the Id to our demo pod

Last thing we need to do is bind the Id we created in step 1, and deployed in step 3, to the pod we deployed in step 2.

Edit the file `/deploy/demo/aadpodidentitybinding.yaml` with the following values:

- azureIdentity: the name for the AzureIdentity you deployed in the previous step, which can remain `demo-aad1`
- selector: in our case, keep the value as `demo`.

Deploy the binding with the following

`./scripts/3-deploy-demo/4-deploy-id-binding.sh`

## Did it work?

You'll need to check the logs of each pod to know if everything worked.

First, get the pod names with the following command:

```sh

$ kubectl get pods
NAME                   READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
demo-757967c54-64pzr   1/1       Running   0          1h     # the demo pod
mic-64ddcf5f65-h4hft   1/1       Running   0          19h    # the MIC pod
nmi-b9xbg              1/1       Running   0          1h     # the NMI pod

```

### Check the Managed Identity Controller pod

Check the logs of the MIC controller and see the binding successfully applied on the node.

```sh

$ kubectl logs mic-64ddcf5f65-h4hft
....

```

### Check the Node Managed Identity pod

Check the logs of the NMI pod to see only info level logging and 200 responses. If you see 403 or 404 responses, then something is wrong.

```sh

$ kubectl logs nmi-b9xbg
...
time="2018-06-07T01:30:04Z" level=info msg="Status (200) took 55422159 ns" req.method=GET req.path=/metadata/identity/oauth2/token req.remote=10.244.0.25
time="2018-06-07T01:30:04Z" level=info msg="matched identityType:0 clientid:a40e83f9-6198-4633-afae-d860eb5b7f7c resource:https://management.azure.com/" req.method=GET req.path=/metadata/identity/oauth2/token req.remote=10.244.0.25

```

### Check the demo pod

The demo pod should be reporting on the virtual machines in the resource group. If you see intermittant 403 responses, that is OK.

```sh

$ kubectl logs demo-757967c54-64pzr
...

## Continuous Deployment with VSTS

This section is optional. 

It shows how to deploy the same pods and infrastructure as above using [VSTS Continuous Integration](https://www.visualstudio.com/team-services/continuous-integration/).

### Configure Kubernetes Connection in VSTS

Give VSTS permission to use your Kubernetes cluster by adding the endpoint to your project. Click the Cog Wheel, and go to Services. Add a new endpoint, and choose Kubernetes. See [this tutorial](https://almvm.azurewebsites.net/labs/vstsextend/kubernetes/) for a more details.

![Screenshot of Kubernetes Endpoint config in VSTS](images/k8s-endpoint-vsts.png)

### Release Definition

Create a new empty Release Definition, and add this repository and a source with alias `_aad_pods`

Add a Task of type 'Deploy to Kubernetes'. Create one of these tasks for each of the following:

> The command of each is `apply`, and the each below shows the reqired arguments.

- `-f _aad-pods/deploy/infra/deployment.yaml`
- `-f _aad-pods/crd/azureAssignedIdentityCrd.yaml`
- `-f _aad-pods/crd/azureIdentityBindingCrd.yaml`
- `-f _aad-pods/crd/azureIdentityCrd.yaml`
- `-f _aad-pods/deploy/demo/deployment.yaml`
- `-f _aad-pods/deploy/demo/aadpodidentity.yaml`
- `-f _aad-pods/deploy/demo/aadpodidentitybinding.yaml`

The result should look like this

![Screenshot of VSTS tasks](images/vsts-deploy-tasks.png)

### Customising each Deployment

You probably don't want to deploy the same Demo every time. To customise the Kubernetes deployment, use the [YAML Writer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jakkaj.vsts-yaml-writer) extension, and edit the values in the YAML files.
