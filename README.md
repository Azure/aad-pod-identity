# AAD Pod Identity

## üì£ Announcement

**‚ùó IMPORTANT**: As of Monday 10/24/2022, AAD Pod Identity is **deprecated**. As mentioned in the [announcement](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/opensource/2022/01/18/announcing-azure-active-directory-azure-ad-workload-identity-for-kubernetes/), AAD Pod Identity has been replaced with [Azure Workload Identity](https://azure.github.io/azure-workload-identity). Going forward, we will no longer add new features or bug fixes to this project in favor of Azure Workload Identity, which reached [General Availability (GA) in AKS](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/ga-azure-active-directory-workload-identity-with-aks-2/). We will provide CVE patches until September 2023, at which time the project will be archived. **There will be no new releases after September 2023.**

AAD Pod Identity enables Kubernetes applications to access cloud resources securely with [Azure Active Directory](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/active-directory/).

Using Kubernetes primitives, administrators configure identities and bindings to match pods. Then without any code modifications, your containerized applications can leverage any resource in the cloud that depends on AAD as an identity provider.
