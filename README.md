# AAD Pod Identity

> **‚ùó IMPORTANT**: As mentioned in the [announcement](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/opensource/2022/01/18/announcing-azure-active-directory-azure-ad-workload-identity-for-kubernetes/), we are planning to replace AAD Pod Identity with [Azure Workload Identity](https://azure.github.io/azure-workload-identity). Going forward, we will no longer add new features to this project in favor of Azure Workload Identity. However, we will continue patching critical bugs and security vulnerabilities until further notice. Refer to [doc](docs/RELEASE.md) for release cadence.

AAD Pod Identity enables Kubernetes applications to access cloud resources securely with [Azure Active Directory](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/active-directory/).

Using Kubernetes primitives, administrators configure identities and bindings to match pods. Then without any code modifications, your containerized applications can leverage any resource in the cloud that depends on AAD as an identity provider.

## Getting Started

Setup the correct [role assignments](https://azure.github.io/aad-pod-identity/docs/getting-started/role-assignment/) on Azure and install AAD Pod Identity through [Helm](https://azure.github.io/aad-pod-identity/docs/getting-started/installation/#helm) or [YAML deployment files](https://azure.github.io/aad-pod-identity/docs/getting-started/installation/#quick-install). Get familiar with our [CRDs](https://azure.github.io/aad-pod-identity/docs/concepts/azureidentity/) and [core components](https://azure.github.io/aad-pod-identity/docs/concepts/mic/).

Try our [walkthrough](https://azure.github.io/aad-pod-identity/docs/demo/standard_walkthrough/) to get a better understanding of the application workflow.

## Release

Currently, AAD Pod Identity releases on a monthly basis to patch security vulnerabilities, targeting the **first** week of the month. Refer to [Release Cadence](docs/RELEASE.md) for more details.
