# E2E Testing

End-to-end (E2E) testing is used to test whether the group of AAD pod identity modules are behaving as designed .

## Get Started

To run the E2E tests in a given Azure subscription, a running Kubernetes cluster created through AKS Engine or Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is required. To collect the cluster's service principal credential, for AKS, you can refer to [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/kubernetes-service-principal). For AKS Engine, if you have an existing cluster, search for the `servicePrincipalProfile` field in `apimodel.json` under the deployment folder. Otherwise, refer to [here](https://github.com/Azure/aks-engine/blob/master/docs/topics/service-principals.md). Also, an Azure keyvault is created to simulate the action of accessing Azure resources.

The E2E tests utilize environment variables to extract certain information. Below is a list of environment variables required. Currently, E2E tests do not automate the creation of Azure resources such as identities and keyvault (but plan to support it in the future). In order to run the tests without errors, you have to create a keyvault within the same resource group as the cluster and insert a test secret into the keyvault.

```bash
# The Azure subscription ID
export SUBSCRIPTION_ID=$(az account list --query "[?name=='<Azure subscription name>'].id" -otsv)

# The Azure resource group name of the Kubernetes cluster
export RESOURCE_GROUP='...'

# The client ID of the service principal that the Azure Kubernetes cluster is using
export AZURE_CLIENT_ID='...'

# The name of the keyvault
export KEYVAULT_NAME='...'

# The name of the secret inserted into the keyvault
export KEYVAULT_SECRET_NAME='...'

# The version of the secret inserted into the keyvault
export KEYVAULT_SECRET_VERSION='...'
```

Optionally, to use custom images:

```bash
# The registry where to get the images from. Defaults to `mcr.microsoft.com/k8s/aad-pod-identity`.
export REGISTRY='...'

# The version of the NMI image to test. Defaults to `1.4`.
export NMI_VERSION='...'

# The version of the MIC image to test. Defaults to `1.3`.
export MIC_VERSION='...'

# The version of the identity validator to test. Defaults to `1.4`.
export IDENTITY_VALIDATOR_VERSION='...'

```

If you are using system asssigned identity cluster, please set the following variable:
```bash
export SYSTEM_MSI_CLUSTER=true
```

The tests utilizes two user assigned identities - `keyvault-identity` (have read access to the keyvault that you create) and `cluster-identity` (have read access to the resource group level). You can create necessary Azure resources and roles with the bash script [`setup.sh`](./setup.sh) (Note that reader assignment in the script might need a few attempts to succeed).

Finally, to start the E2E tests, execute the following commands:

```bash
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/Azure/aad-pod-identity

# Ensure that the local project and the dependencies are in sync
make mod

make e2e
```

## Identity Validator

During the E2E test run, the image [`identityvalidator`](../../images/identityvalidator/Dockerfile) is deployed as a Kubernetes deployment to the cluster to validate the pod identity. The binary `identityvalidator` within the pod is essentially the compiled version of [`identityvalidator.go`](identityvalidator/identityvalidator.go). If the binary execution returns an exit status of 0, it means that the pod identity and its binding are working properly. Otherwise, it means that the pod identity is not established. You can manually try out the identity validator by executing the following command:

```bash
# Deploy aad pod identity infra and create an identity validator deployment (make sure the go template parameters are replaced by the desired values)
kubectl apply -f ../../deploy/infra/deployment-rbac.yaml
kubectl apply -f test/e2e/template/aadpodidentity.yaml
kubectl apply -f test/e2e/template/aadpodidentitybinding.yaml
kubectl apply -f test/e2e/template/deployment.yaml

# Get the pod name of identity validator deployment
kubectl get pods

# Execute the binary within the pod
kubectl exec <identity validator pod name> -- identityvalidator
                                           --subscription-id "$SUBSCRIPTION_ID" \
                                           --resource-group "$RESOURCE_GROUP" \
                                           --identity-client-id "$AZURE_CLIENT_ID" \
                                           --keyvault-name "$KEYVAULT_NAME" \
                                           --keyvault-secret-name "$KEYVAULT_SECRET_NAME" \
                                           --keyvault-secret-version "$KEYVAULT_SECRET_VERSION"

# Check the exit status
echo "$?"
```

## Test Flow

To ensure consistency across all tests, they generally follow the format below:

1. Alter the Azure resource group (create user assigned identities, assign reader role, etc)
2. Alter the Kubernetes cluster (creating pods, deployments, services, etc)
3. Inject Kubernetes pod identities and pod identity bindings
4. Deploy the identity validator to the cluster
5. Assertions
6. Clean up the testing environment

## Supported Tests

| Test Description | Expected Result | Category |
| - | - | - |
| Add an AzureIdentity and AzureBinding, deploy identity validator with the label marked in binding | New AzureAssignedIdentity is created and the underlying node assigned identity, and identity validator should be able to access Azure resources | Basic |
| With AzureIdentity, AzureBinding and identity validator deployed, remove the AzureIdentity | AzureAssignedIdentity should get removed and identity validator should not be able to access Azure resources | Basic |
| With AzureIdentity, AzureBinding and identity validator deployed, remove the AzureIdentityBinding | AzureAssignedIdentity should get removed and identity validator should not be able to access Azure resources | Basic |
| With AzureIdentity, AzureBinding and identity validator deployed, remove the identity validator deployment | AzureAssignedIdentity should get removed | Basic |
| With AzureIdentity, AzureBinding and identity validator deployed, remove the immutable identity based deployment | Immutable identity should be removed from the cluster but shouldn't be deleted from VM/VMSS | Basic |
| Add an AzureIdentity and AzureBinding, deploy identity validator with the label marked in binding, then drain the node containing the identity validator deployment | A new AzureAssignedIdentity should be established with the new pod and the old one should be removed | Advanced |
| Add a number of AzureIdentities and AzureIdentityBindings in order and remove them in random order | The correct identities and identity binding should be removed and the rest should remain untouched | Random |
| Enable a user assigned identity on VMs, then assign a different user assigned identity to a pod | Pod identity should work as expected and the user assigned identity on VMs should not be altered after deletingÂ the pod identity | Advanced |
| Enable a user assigned identity on VMs, then assign the same user assigned identity to a pod | Pod identity should work as expected and the user assigned identity on VMs should not be altered after deleting the pod identity | Advanced |
| Enable system assigned identity on VMs, then assign a user assigned identity to a pod | Pod identity should work as expected and the system assigned identity on VMs should not be altered after deleting the pod identity | Advanced |
| Enforce user assigned identity format validation constraint with Gatekeeper | Azure identity with invalid resource ID should not be accepted | Advanced |

## Development

The test utilized [ginkgo](http://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/) as the base test framework. The tests are written in [aadpodidentity_test.go](aadpodidentity_test.go) and more tests can be appended at the end of the file.
