When it detects a relevant change, the MIC adds or deletes AzureAssignedIdentity as needed.\nSpecifically, when a pod is scheduled, the MIC assigns the identity on Azure to the underlying VM/VMSS during the creation phase. When the pod is deleted, it removes the identity from the underlying VM/VMSS on Azure. The MIC takes similar actions when AzureIdentity or AzureIdentityBinding are created or deleted.\nNode Managed Identity The authorization request to fetch a Service Principal Token from an MSI endpoint is sent to Azure Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) endpoint (169.254.169.254), which is redirected to the NMI pod. The redirection is accomplished by adding iptable rules to redirect all non-host traffic with IMDS endpoint on port 80 as destination to the NMI endpoint. The NMI server identifies the pod based on the remote address of the request and then queries Kubernetes (through MIC) for a matching Azure identity. NMI then makes an Azure Active Directory Authentication Library (ADAL) request to get the token for the client ID and returns it as a response. If the request had client ID as part of the query, it is validated against the admin-configured client ID.\nHere is an example cURL command that will fetch an access token to access ARM within a pod identified by an AAD-Pod-Identity selector:\ncurl 'http://169.254.169.254/metadata/identity/oauth2/token?api-version=2018-02-01\u0026resource=https%3A%2F%2Fmanagement.azure.com%2F' -H Metadata:true -s For different ways to acquire an access token within a pod, please refer to this documentation.\nSimilarly, a host can make an authorization request to fetch Service Principal Token for a resource directly from the NMI host endpoint (http://127.0.0.1:2579/host/token/). The request must include the pod namespace podns and the pod name podname in the request header and the resource endpoint of the resource requesting the token. The NMI server identifies the pod based on the podns and podname in the request header and then queries k8s (through MIC) for a matching azure identity. Then NMI makes an ADAL request to get a token for the resource in the request, returning the token and the clientid as a response.\nHere is an example cURL command:\ncurl http://127.0.0.1:2579/host/token/?resource=https://vault.azure.net -H \"podname: nginx-flex-kv-int\" -H \"podns: default\" For more information, please refer to the design documentation.\n","excerpt":"Managed Identity Controller The Managed Identity Controller (MIC) is a …","ref":"/aad-pod-identity/docs/getting-started/components/","title":"Components"},{"body":" Available from 1.3.0-mic-1.4.0-nmi release\n By default, AAD Pod Identity matches pods to identities across namespaces.

There are three sections, and each section contains several scripts to run. You’ll find all the scripts in the tutorial directory.\nTo begin, clone this repository\ngit clone https://github.com/Azure/aad-pod-identity cd aad-pod-identity/tutorial Using Azure CLI, kubectl and bash The following steps require the Azure CLI, make sure to download and login before starting.\nIf you’re on Windows, you should use Windows Subsystem for Linux or another Bash terminal.\nYou can install kubectl via the Azure CLI, or by another method\naz aks install-cli\n1. Create a Kubernetes Cluster on Azure (AKS) 1.1. Register the required resource types ./1-init-aks/1-azure-provider-registration.sh\nAKS requires the following resources: Microsoft.Network, Microsoft.Storage, Microsoft.Compute, Microsoft.ContainerService. Register them on your subscription with the above script.\n1.2. Create a Resource Group Set an environment variable in your shell, for the name of your resource group.\nexport RG=\"k8s-test\"\nThis resource group is for your AKS cluster. Create it with this command.\n./1-init-aks/2-create-rg.sh\n1.3. Create Azure Kubernetes Service This will create an AKS instance in the resource group created above. It may take a couple of minutes to complete. Set the name of the this command in the shell.\nK8S_NAME=\"Cluster-Name\" ./1-init-aks/3-create-aks.sh 1.4. Configure the kubernetes CLI - kubectl With kubectl installed, run the following script\n./1-init-aks/4-configure-cli.sh\nNow the kubectl command should control your AKS cluster. Try it out, it should look similar to below:\n$ kubectl get nodes NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION aks-nodepool1-15831963-0 Ready agent 01h v1.9.6 2. Configure AKS with required infrastructure on the cluster Pod Identity requires two components:\n Managed Identity Controller (MIC). A pod that binds Azure Ids to other pods - creates azureAssignedIdentity CRD. Node Managed Identity (NMI). Identifies the pod based on the remote address of the incoming request, and then queries the k8s (through MIC) for a matching Azure Id. It then make a adal request to get the token for the client id and returns as a response to the request. Implemented as a DaemonSet.  Deploy the infrastructure with the following command to deploy MIC, NMI, and MIC CRDs.\n./2-config-aks/2-deploy-infra.sh\nNOTE: If you have RBAC enabled, use the following deployment instead:\nkubectl create -f ../../deploy/infra/deployment-rbac.yaml\r3. Deploy the demo The demo is basic, but does prove the concept.\n3.1. Create an Azure Id We will be assigning the demo pod an Azure Managed Service Identity. The Azure Id will need to be in the same Resource Group as was created automatically by the provisioning of the AKS cluster see this issue for more information.\nYou might find the Resource Group name with\naz group list | grep $RG\nThen set the environment variable\nexport MC_RG=\"resource-group-name\"\nRun the following to create an azure id\n./3-deploy-demo/1-create-azure-id.sh\n3.2. Deploy demo The /deploy/demo/deployment.yaml describes the pod that will be deployed.\nIt automatically adds the following values from your environment:\n subscriptionid: Id of your Azure Subscription clientid: From the Azure Id you created in the step above resourcegroup: From the Azure Id you created above  Run the following to deploy the demo\n./3-deploy-demo/2-deploy-demo.sh\n3.3. Deploy Azure Id to Kubernetes We need to tell the cluster about the Id we created, so it can bind it to the pod (the next step). To do that, we will deploy the spec found in /deploy/demo/aadpodidentity.yaml.\nRun the following to deploy the Azure ID to Kubernetes:\n./3-deploy-demo/3-deploy-id-to-k8s.sh\n3.4. Bind the Id to our demo pod Last thing we need to do is bind the Id we created in step 1, and deployed in step 3, to the pod we deployed in step 2.\nDeploy the binding with the following\n./3-deploy-demo/4-deploy-id-binding.sh\nDid it work? You’ll need to check the logs of each pod to know if everything worked.\nFirst, get the pod names with the following command:\n$ kubectl get pods NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE demo-757967c54-64pzr 1/1 Running 0 1h # the demo pod mic-64ddcf5f65-h4hft 1/1 Running 0 19h # the MIC pod nmi-b9xbg 1/1 Running 0 1h # the NMI pod Check the Managed Identity Controller pod Check the logs of the MIC controller and see the binding successfully applied on the node.\n$ kubectl logs mic-64ddcf5f65-h4hft ....

This identity is set during the cluster bring up process. This is not included in the scope of this proposal.\n  User Identity: What enables user/operator to authenticate against AAD using AAD before using kubectl commands. This is not included in the scope of this proposal.\n  Application Identities: Identities that are used by applications running on kubernetes to access any resources that uses AAD as identity provider. These resources can be ARM, Applications running on the same cluster, on azure, or anywhere else. Managing, assigning these identities is the scope of this document.\n   This proposal does not cover how application can be configured to use AAD as identity/authentication provider.\n Use cases  Kubernetes applications depending on other applications that use AAD as an identity provider. These applications include Azure first party services such as ARM, Azure SQL, and Azure KeyVault.   Azure 1st party services are all moving to use AAD as the primary identity provider.\n  Delegating authorization to tools such as AAD group memberships.\n  Enable identity rotation without application interruption.\n   Example: rotating a service principal password/cert without having to edit secrets assigned directly to applications.\n Provide a framework to enable time-boxed identity assignment. Manually triggered or automated. The same framework can be used for (jit sudo style access with automation tools).   Example: a front end application can have access to centralized data store between midnight and 1 AM during business days only.\n Guiding Principles   Favor little to no change to how users currently write applications against various editions of ADAL. Favor committing changes to SDKs and don’t ask users to change applications that are written for Kubernetes.\n  Favor little to no change in the way users create kubernetes application specs (favor declarative approach). This enables users to focus their development and debugging experience in code they wrote, not code imposed on them.\n   Example: favor annotation and labels over side-cars (even dynamically injected).\n Separate identities from identity assignment applications enables users to swap identities used by the applications.  Processes AAD Identity Management and Assignment (within cluster)   Cluster operators create instances of crd:azureIdentity. Each instance is a kubernetes object representing Azure AAD identity that can be EMSI or service principal (with password).\n  Cluster operators create instances of crd:azureIdentityBinding.

However, it does not perform any sort of token caching. We believe that either the users or the SDK that your application is using is responsible for token management.\nNote that there is a brief window between when your application started running and the identity gets assigned to the underlying node. If your application tried to retrieve an access token during that period, it might fail. The following table describes the duration that you could expect to wait based on your cluster’s node type:\n   Node Type Identity Assignment Duration     Virtual Machine 10 - 20 seconds   Virtual Machine Scale Set 40 - 60 seconds     Note: the delay only occurs when the user-assigned identity is not assigned to the underlying node on Azure. Subsequent token requests will not incur this delay after identity assignment.\n By default, when fetching an access token, NMI performs 16 retries with 5 seconds in between each retry to check whether the AzureIdentity assigned to your pod has been successfully assigned to the underlying node on Azure. It will return an error if it is still not assigned after 16 retries x 5 seconds = 80 seconds. Also, your workload might encounter an error if it times out before NMI finishes this operation. You can adjust the number of retries and the delay in between each retry via the NMI flags --retry-attempts-for-created and --find-identity-retry-interval.\nAdditional retry logic is also implemented internally in most of Azure’s SDKs to prevent your application from erroring out. For example, azure-sdk-for-go by default performs five retries with exponential backoff when fetching an access token from IMDS.\nAlternatively, you could set up a simple init container to probe for successful identity assignment by MIC and prevent applications from starting prematurely.

When the optional parameter enabledScaleFeatures is set to ‘true’, the NMI watches for AzureAssignedIdentities will do a label based filtering on the nodename label. This approach is taken because currently K8s does not support field selectors in CRD watches. This reduces the load which NMIs add on API server. When this flag is enabled, NMI will no longer work for AzureAssignedIdentities which were created before 1.5.3-rc5, since they don’t have the labels.

The response includes information on the operating system and image, tags, resource IDs, network, and VM custom data.\nThis information is legitimately useful for many use cases, but also presents a risk. If an attacker can exploit a vulnerability that allows them to read from this endpoint, they may be able to access sensitive information even if the vulnerable Pod does not use Managed Identity.\nThe blockInstanceMetadata flag for NMI will intercept any requests to this endpoint from Pods which are not using host networking and return an HTTP 403 Forbidden response. This flag is disabled by default to maximize compatibility.

Following guidelines should be followed when developing E2E tests:\n  Use the aad-pod-identity e2e test framework.\n  Define test spec reflecting real user workflow, e.g. creation of AzureIdentity, AzureIdentityBinding and a pod that consumes the identity.\n  See test/e2e/README.md on how to run the aad-pod-identity e2e test suite locally.\n","excerpt":"CLA The AAD Pod Identity project welcomes contributions and …","ref":"/aad-pod-identity/docs/contributing/","title":"Contributing"},{"body":"Logging Below is a list of commands you can use to view relevant logs of aad-pod-identity components.\nIsolate errors from logs You can use grep ^E and --since flag from kubectl to isolate any errors occurred after a given duration.\nkubectl logs -l component=mic --since=1h | grep ^E kubectl logs -l component=nmi --since=1h | grep ^E  It is always a good idea to include relevant logs from MIC and NMI when opening a new issue.\n Ensure that iptables rule exists To ensure that the correct iptables rule is injected to each node via the NMI pods, the following command ensures that on a given node, there exists an iptables rule where all packets with a destination IP of 169.254.169.254 (IMDS endpoint) are routed to port 2579 of the host network.\nNMI_POD=$(kubectl get pod -l component=nmi -ojsonpath='{.items[?(@.spec.nodeName==\"\u003cNodeName\u003e\")].metadata.name}') kubectl exec $NMI_POD -- iptables -t nat -S aad-metadata The expected output should be:\n-N aad-metadata\r-A aad-metadata ! -s 127.0.0.1/32 -d 169.254.169.254/32 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 80 -j DNAT --to-destination 10.240.0.34:2579\r-A aad-metadata -j RETURN\rRun a pod to validate your identity setup You could run the following commands to validate your identity setup (assuming you have the proper AzureIdentity and AzureIdentityBinding deployed):\nkubectl run azure-cli -it --image=mcr.microsoft.com/azure-cli --labels=aadpodidbinding=\u003cselector defined in AzureIdentityBinding\u003e /bin/bash # within the azure-cli shell az login -i --debug az login -i will use the Azure identity bound to the azure-cli pod and perform a login to Azure via Azure CLI.
